        Open source projects have given birth to a range of useful software over the years. Many of the great technologies that we use today were born out of open source development! Android, Firefox, VLC media player, MongoDB, Linux, Docker and Python just to name a few.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">

        However, the large majority of contributors to open source projects don’t work for tech giants; anyone can leave their mark on an important piece of open software or create their own “next big thing”. Being part of an open source project can also help you improve your skills, learn something new, get mentorship or form life long friendships. Contributing to open source projects should be mutually beneficial in both the short and long term. Many companies actively hire full-time developers from those contributing the most to a project, and so doing so can be a great way to show off your skills, while learning new ones.

    <h2 class="blog-h2">
      #1. Assess yourself
    </h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        The first step is to assess any technical or non-technical skill that you have or want to improve. Ask yourself where can I add the most value? This could be directly helping to write code, testing for bugs or even helping to improve documentation so others can use the software more efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">
      #2. Get to know GitHub
    </h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Almost all open source projects used a version control system, a tool that helps with merging new code into the project (the main “repository”). Usually, the collaboration is centred around a website that hosts the central repository. These websites include Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab, thought Github is by far the most popular one and the one we use here at MindsDB.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Generally speaking, version control systems allow keeping track of all changes in a project without saving several files. Make an account on Github, login and explore all the different tabs on the top of the website. Here you will find information about Github, development guides, open source projects, events, conferences etc.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">#3. Search for relevant projects and join the community</h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Search for relevant projects on Github based on your skil1s. You can use Github Explore for this purpose or sign-up for Code Triage to get an email on a different issue every day. While choosing a project to start on, look for a project that is actively maintained (loads of commits) and has a lot of issues. Once you have found your relevant projects, Star & Fork the project, subscribe to its mailing list and slack channel. This is the best way to get help if you are stuck in setting up the project or making your first contribution.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">Making your first contribution</h2>
    <h2 class="blog-h2">#1. Making your first contribution</h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        First, try the software, install it and have a play, try to break it, see if it does what it says on the box. This is a great place where you can start to add value very easily, by reporting any issues you find. Each project is likely to have a slightly different template for reporting issues, but essentially they all contain similar information.  
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">#2. Explore existing Issues
    </h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Once you have figured out the project you want to contribute to, explore its Github repository, read the documents and go to the issues tab. Here you will find all the open issues that you can work on. These issues can be from beginner level to advance level. If the repository is properly maintained, the issues would be tagged with “beginner”, “first-timers”, “help-wanted” etc. so that you can work on the easiest tasks to gain confidence and experience with the project.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">#3. Help improve documentation
    </h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        However, you don’t have to code right away. You can contribute to documentation, creating the developer’s guide, helping other people solve their issues, etc. Read the documentation and if you feel something is missing this can be a great first place to contribute. You can either raise an issue or, if you feel confident enough, you can add the missing parts yourself.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">#4. Suggest new features
    </h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
        If you like the project and find it useful, you can also start to request new features to help improve it.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
    You should mention all the projects that you have contributed to on your CV or add a link to your GitHub account on your CV or in a cover letter. Most employers are impressed with such accolades and prefer such candidates for hiring.

    You can also become a mentor to people who are new to open source development. It’s time to give back to the community and give guidance to the ones who are just starting out.
