        Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Blood Dragon is an attempt by Ubisoft to release
        an expansion as a stand alone game, coming in at a low price point.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        The order of the day is a different mix of action to what we’ve come to
        expect from the Far Cry series, and a complete 180 from the original Far
        Cry 3 release.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Have Ubisoft managed to fit enough content and enjoyment into the mix?
        Read on to find out!
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-h2">The Review</h2>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        In <em>Blood Dragon</em>, the year is 2007, and the world is suffering
        the aftermath of a nuclear war. Technology and man has become one in the
        same, with the U.S army creating cyborg super soldiers. You play as Rex,
        an American cybernetic super-soldier, sent in with another operative and
        friend, Spider, to investigate Colonel Sloan, an elite agent who has
        gone rogue, stopping the launch of a nuclear missile in the process.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        <em>Far Cry 3</em>: Blood Dragon is designed with a very retro style
        look to it. Everything is full of bright colors despite being set in a
        destroyed wasteland, and is accompanied by a very fitting retro musical
        score. The game takes quite a few references from iconic movies and
        shows from the eighties, the most notable example being the Terminator.
      </p>

        Vehicles exist in the game although they are few and far between. There
        are basically three in the game: a jeep (with or without a mounted gun),
        a boat, and a hang-glider. They will respawn upon death or game loading,
        and the cyber soldiers wil occasionally appear randomly driving either a
        boat or a jeep.

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon plays like any basic open world game, and if you
        have ever played Far Cry 2 or Far Cry 3, the game is very similar in
        style, yet not in substance. The game has barely anything to do in its
        world.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        You have two types of side missions, rescue and hunting, but they are
        always the same, but with more or less enemies and at different
        locations. Completing these missions, however, unlock modifications for
        the weapons you find throughout the game, allowing them to become more
        powerful and/or useful as you progress. There are collectibles in the
        game, such as finding VHS tapes and old televisions, but they feel
        tacked on and boring.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        While playing the game, the games soundtrack really stood out the most,
        full of upbeat pop and retro music that somehow managed to fit the
        worlds theme. The games difficulty is fairly balanced, i found myself
        dying a few times, but never really being overwhelmed, especially being
        able to recover health most of the game, even without needing any
        injections, a balance breaker I have hated since Far Cry 2.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-h2">System Benchmark</h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        As with all PC games, I strongly advise following the recommended system
        specs to ensure a smooth and enjoyable game.
      </p>

      <ul style="line-height: 3">
        <li>
          OS: Windows® XP (SP3) / Windows Vista® (SP2) / Windows® 7 (SP1) /
          Windows® 8
        </li>
        <li>
          Processor: 2.93 GHz Intel® Core™ i3–530 or 3.10 GHz AMD Phenom™ II X2
          550 or better
        </li>
        <li>Memory: 4 GB</li>
        <li>Graphics: 1024 MB DirectX 11–complaint or higher</li>
        <li>DirectX®: DirectX® 11</li>
        <li>Hard Drive: 3 GB HD space</li>
        <li>Requires a UPlay account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="blog-h2">The Verdict</h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Fans of Far Cry 2 and Far Cry 3, as well as those who love retro culture
        in their video games, will enjoy Blood Dragon. Coming in at around
        $20AU, it’s debatable if the price is worth it, as the content is rather
        lacking, but the incredible sound track, voice work and the fact it
        remains a stand alone expansion almost justifies the price.
