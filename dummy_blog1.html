      Creating variables and using them can be thought of as one of the earliest and simplest concepts when we start
      learning to program. In JavaScript, if you don't have a good understanding of variables it can create a lot of
      problems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">What are Variables?</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Variables are containers for storing data (values). JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
      There are some rules that one should keep in mind before creating variables:
      <ul style="line-height: 2">
        <li>Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
        <li>Variable names should start with a letter.</li>
        <li>Variable names are case sensitive for eg read and READ are two different variable.</li>
        <li>Some names are reserved in JavaScript. So, we cannot use the same keywords for naming variables.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Assignment Operator</h3>
      In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is known as "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. Remember equality
      operators like '==' are different from assignment operator.

      <h3>There are three ways to create a variable in JavaScript:</h3>
      <ul style="line-height: 2">
        <li>var</li>
        <li>let</li>
        <li>const</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Creating variables with var, let and const</h4>
      <img alt="var declaration" class="blog-img" src="Images/var.JPG" />
      <img alt="let declaration" class="blog-img" src="Images/let.JPG" />
      <img alt="const declaration" class="blog-img" src="Images/const.JPG" />
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      There are pros and cons of using var, let and const. We will discuss them in the next section.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">understanding the difference between var, let and const</h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The value of variables created using var and let can be updated/changed but const as the name suggest has a
      constant value that cannot be changed.
      If you tried changing const variable value it will throw an error. The error describes what we did wrong.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      One more thing we need to understand is that creating variables without using var, let and const is a bad
      practice. By default JavaScript will create a var variable if you do not follow this rule which will further lead
      to problems and you don't want that. Before ES6, mostly var was used but JavaScript developers understood the cons
      of using var and thus came up with new ways to create variables.
    </p>

    <h3>understanding Scoping in JavaScript</h3>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Before we discuss about the second difference we need to know about scoping.
      Scoping is a big topic and has a lot of importance in JavaScript. So, right now we only need to know how scoping
      affects variables.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <ul style="line-height: 2">
        <li>var variables are scoped differently than let and const variables.</li>
        <li>var variables are function scoped variables (they are only available within the parent
          function)</li>
        <li>let and const variables ar block scoped variables.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      So, what is function scoped? Anything that sits inside { and } is called a block. You must have written code
      inside curly braces while working with functions, loops and conditional statements.</p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The scope is global when a var
      variable is declared outside a function. This means
      that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window. var
      is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only
      within that function.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      variable declared in a block with let is only available
      for use within that block.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Just like let, const is only available for use within a block but unlike let const variables cannot be updated.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-h2">The Verdict</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      So, this blog was written keeping in mind how much should beginners know about variables. I have recently started
      coding in JavaScript and one thing I believe I should have understood while learning the fundamentals is learning
      about what JavaScript variables are and when to use them. A week ago it took me like two hours to debug my code
      because I used only var to declare all my variables. I will not tell you why and how it happened because I believe
      one day you will be stuck in same situation and believe me figuring out these things on your own is the best way
      to learn.
