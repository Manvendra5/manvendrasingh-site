        The Modern JavaScript Tutorial was created in 2007 by Ilya Kantor, and regularly updated since then. New chapters were added, outdated ones - removed, to stay fresh. The PDF version is about 1300 pages, starting from the beginning, and then to advanced topics. It's a book, not a video, as for many people reading is faster. Also, books are easier to update, keep modern :).

      MDN is more of a reference tool. Not really structured for learning by newbies. But it is an excellent resource for folks that already have a decent background with the technologies they are reading about. Yes MDN is the best online resource for learning HTML and CSS.

      Javascript 30 is great for showing you some basic ways you can use javascript to create or alter websites. Others are right that there are other "more important" things to learn, but practising code and seeing some simple working examples is also very useful.
