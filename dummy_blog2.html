    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Below are the top 3 books that I love the most. One of the reasons I like these books is that mostly I take
      around 5-6 days to complete a book but I finished reading these books in 1-2 days. They are worth the time you

      #1. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock Holmes #3)
    </h2>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is the third Sherlock Holmes book, First is A Study In Scarlet, and the second
      is The Sign Of Four. This book is a collection of twelve short stories about the cases of Sherlock Holmes. My
      personal favorite from the stories is The Speckled Band. In The Speckled Band, A woman named Helen Stoner, who
      lives with her stepfather, Dr. Grimsby Roylott, asks for Holmes’ help. Her twin sister was murdered in her
      bedroom under suspicious circumstances two years earlier and mentioned a speckled band just before dying. It is
      essentially an impossible crime. She is found murdered in a locked room and there are no obvious entrances or
      exits from it. How was the crime committed? How did the murderer escape? Seemingly only supernatural means can
      explain this impossible situation. But a detective like Sherlock Holmes will figure out how it all really
      happened. Holmes with his deduction skills and immaculate observational skills solves the case.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">The stories in
      The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are a fantastic way to deepen your understanding of Sherlock’s fascinating
      personality. The best thing about these stories is that they are short around 20 pages long and are not linked.
      So, you can read them whenever you want. I believe it is hard to put this book down once you start reading it.</p>

      #2. Born to Run
      <span>by Christopher McDougall</span>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Christopher McDougall is an author, journalist, and TED speaker, and of course, an avid runner. It wasn’t always
      easy for him, though. He suffered from a painful foot ailment that doctors said would prevent him from ever
      running again. One day he came across a magazine and on its cover was a picture of Tarahumara Indians of Mexico,
      who are the best distance runners in the world. He wondered how these people are able to run long distances
      without getting injured. So, he embarked on a journey to find out the secret of Tarahumara runners.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I related to this story a lot. I always wondered why my legs get sore after a long run and what can I do to run
      long
      distances without getting injured. Here are the 3 most helpful lessons I’ve learned from this book:
      <ul style="line-height: 2">
        <li>
          We are born to run long distances.
        </li>
        <li>We should practice barefoot running. Do you know some top olympic athletes practice barefoot running to
          perfect there running form?</li>
        <li>Learn how to run with the right form and buy right shoes with flat sole.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">Christopher McDougall has done thoruough research on the things we are doing wrong about
      running. This book is not about boring analytics about how we can run long distances. It is a story about the
      greatest race that world has ever seen. A race between the new age ultra runners against the Tarahumaras.</p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">If you have lately missing on the motivation to run or getting injured, then this book is
      for you. This book can make you rediscover your love for running and doing it the most
      simple way as our ancestors did.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/b1/b7/3e/b1b73e9d5d447e1284c7bec776f3705e.jpg" alt="Angels and Demons" />
    </div>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Angels and Demons by Dan Brown introduce Harvard symbology professor Robert Langdon in a breathtaking adventure to
      save the Vatican City, Rome from a threat from an ancient brotherhood that died four hundred years ago.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">The story begins with Robert Langdon receiving a phone call asking him to come to CERN (a
      research facility in
      Switzerland) immediately. When he refused, he was sent a photograph of a dead physicist, on his chest branded an
      ambigram which read one word, Illuminati. Illuminati is a fraternity that fought religion and Church for decades.
      Illumination means lighting, as to enlighten humans from their ignorance caused by the Church, and orienting them
      to the path of light, of science.</p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The story involves a CERN director (Maximilian Kohler), a physicist's daughter (Vittoria Vetra) and Robert Langdon
      who will prevent the Vatican from getting destroyed by antimatter created by
      Vittoria's murdered father. That creation was done as a weapon thus Langdon and the scientist Vittoria will go
      through a sort of treasure hunt which will involve various ancient places and several people like the Pope,
      priests and the Illuminati in order to find the weapon and stop the destruction of the "home of the Catholic
      Church".
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Angels & Demons is indeed an intelligent and fascinating read. The Science vs. Religion angle is superbly written.
      Since the existence of science, the Catholic Church has always found a way to condemn scientists’ findings or to
      punish those who proves otherwise what the church had been teaching. In all those centuries ago, a lot of people
      were killed, prosecuted because of science and it’s proof of how things actually are, which
      disproved how the Bible explained those same things.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I believe this book also shows that science and religion need not be in contrast with each other, rather should be
      looked upon as partners. Also, all things come from something and yes, all God’s miracles may someday be explained
      and scientifically done.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I will rate this book 10/10. A must read.
