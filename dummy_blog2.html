        The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is the series of short stories that
        made the fortunes of the Strand magazine, in which they were first
        published, and won immense popularity for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.
        The detective is at the height of his powers and the volume is full of
        famous cases, including 'The Red-Headed League', 'The Blue Carbuncle',
        and 'The Speckled Band'. Although Holmes gained a reputation for
        infallibility, Conan Doyle showed his own realism and feminism by having
        the great detective defeated by Irene Adler - the woman - in the very
        first story, 'A Scandal in Bohemia'. The editor of this volume, Richard
        Lancelyn Green is editor of The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes and The
        Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. With John Michael Gibson, he
        compiled the Soho Series Bibliography of A. Conan Doyle.

        Jason Dessen is walking home through the chilly Chicago streets one
        night, looking forward to a quiet evening in front of the fireplace with
        his wife, Daniela, and their son, Charlie—when his reality shatters.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">'Are you happy in your life?'</p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the masked abductor
        knocks him unconscious. Before he awakes to find himself strapped to a
        gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits. Before the man he's
        never met smiles down at him and says, 'Welcome back.'
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        In this world he's woken up to, Jason's life is not the one he knows.
        His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an
        ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has
        achieved something remarkable. Something impossible.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Is it this world or the other that's the dream? And even if the home he
        remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he
        loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than
        anything he could've imagined—one that will force him to confront the
        darkest parts of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly
        unbeatable foe.
